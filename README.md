# Data Analytics Portfolio Projects
I started working with data when one of my projects at work required me to collect all the files with reports and data 
created so far in the company into a coherent and transparent database. At first, I worked with what was available, 
i.e., I tried to organize Excel files so that they used formulas and macros, and pivot tables became the standard 
for extracting specific data. In the meantime, I became interested in SQL and trained myself to create a real database 
so that I could implement the system in the company and connect it to the forms I had created in MS Access. This sparked 
my interest in data analysis, and wanting to develop further in this direction, I decided to create this portfolio 
in which I will share my work.
